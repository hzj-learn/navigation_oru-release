This package have some simple interface to Kollmorgens .wef files.
You can load the files and extract the spline paths and start / goal poses. This is used to check the performance of the MPC controller vs. the Kollmorgen one and to check the path planner / smoothing accuracy vs. a manually drawn path.

To get the start and goal poses use the --save_goals parameters with the wef2path utils as:
rosrun orunav_path_pool wef2path --wef_file_name OU_repe2.wef --save_goals
generates OU_repre2.wef.goals.

These poses can then be used as input to the path pool based planner (check the orunav_vehicle_execution/targets) and use the vehicle_execution_client (in orunav_vehicle_execution pkg) or similar.

Note that there is also possible to load a directory containing a set of .path files and use them in a similar fashion - that is you don't have to start with a .wef file at all.

-----

Example of using a .wef file
roslaunch path_pool.launch
sh ./service_call_example.sh (from the path_pool/launch dir)

Example of using a path directory
roslaunch path_pool_using_pathfiles.launch
sh ./service_call_example.sh (from the path_pool/launch dir)

The latter example usess a set of autogenerated path files from a wef file (OU_base.wef). All paths were generated running:
rosrun orunav_path_pool wef2path --wef_file_name OU_base.wef --save_paths
