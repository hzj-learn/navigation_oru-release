# This file contains an example graph of a set of poses (vertices) and edges between them
# each pose is given on one line as 
# id x,y,th: such that th is given in degrees 
# each edge is specified on one line
# the format of an edge is as follows:
# id spose_id epose_id cost 
# id: is the id of the edge; 
# spose_id, epose_id: ids of start and end poses of the edge
# cost: the cost of traversing the edge



# First we give the poses
BeginPoses # this is mandatory
