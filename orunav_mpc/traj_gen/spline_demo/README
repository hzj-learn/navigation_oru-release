Trajectory generator connects N points using cubic splines. All state information
except the initial and final car orientations is ignored. Initial and final
orientations are enforced using kGains parameter. 

* The first and second derivatives are continuous along the whole trajectory. The 
third derivative is not continuous in the points of connection of polynomials. 
Consequently, the steering velocity is not reliable, and trajectory cannot be 
reproduced by applying control inputs.

* Satisfaction of constraints (on velocities, angles, positions) is not guaranteed.

* The whole trajectory must be processed at the same time.

* Only positive tangential velocities are generated.


demo1:
    * Geometric path description is separated from the timing information as
    described in (1).

    * Velocity profile (d\sigma / dt) is also generated using a cubic polynomial.
    Initial and final velocities are 0.

    * kGains define initial and final velocities with respect to the arc length 
    (dx/d\sigma).

    * The time constraints are imposed by assigning time stamps to fractions of
    \sigma.

demo2
    * The timing information is not separated.

    * The time constraints are imposed by assigning timestamps to particular states.
    
    * kGains are the actual initial and final velocities. Consequently these
    velocities are not equal to zero.
